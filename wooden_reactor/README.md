Introducing the DIY Wooden Reactor Simulatorâ€”a versatile creation crafted from Oak, Alder, and Walnut veneers, encased in a glass flask with intricate copper wire details. This multifunctional piece boasts dynamic lighting effects including animated filaments, color-changing optical fibers, and immersive sound simulations for each phase. Controlled via WLED, it offers customizable brightness, sound volume, particle colors, and effects, making it ideal for both functional use and aesthetic enjoyment. Perfect for enthusiasts looking to integrate unique craftsmanship with advanced technology.

Features:

    Multiple Light Sources:
    Addressable LED strip
    Optical fiber
    LED filaments and flexible LED filaments
    Wireless charging
    USB Quick Charger
    WiFi control
    Technology:
    Based on ESP32
    Includes MP3 module and speaker
    Controlled by WLED with a custom usermod for enhanced features

Phases of the Reactor:

    Phase 1 - Preheating (Nightlight) Mode:

    Simulates pre-heating with animated red filaments in the bottom and top parts of the reactor.
    Color animations in optical fibers.
    Electrical sound and light fluctuations accompany startup, creating a cozy nightlight effect.

    Phase 2 - Full Power (Desk Lamp) Mode:

    Activates three rings of LED filaments (bottom: warm, middle: mix, top: white) for optimal illumination.
    Turbine sound increases frequency, simulating turbine animation.
    Full light power enabled with accompanying sound effects and visual splashes, perfect for desk lamp use.

    Phase 3 - Particles Mode:

    Simulates particles animation with addressable LED strips built into the reactor holders on the sides.
    Dynamic visual effects create a captivating light show.

    Phase 4 - Custom Effects Mode:

    Allows switching between various WLED-powered effects.
    Customizable light and sound effects enhance the visual experience.

Control and Interaction:

The reactor features four stands with built-in sliders for intuitive control:

    Slider 1: Change brightness
    Slider 2: Adjust sound volume
    Slider 3: Change particle colors
    Slider 4: Switch predefined custom effects

Additionally, the reactor includes four switches, each corresponding to a different phase of the reactor:

    Switch 1 - Preheating (Nightlight) Mode
    Switch 2 - Full Power (Desk Lamp) Mode
    Switch 3 - Particles Mode
    Switch 4 - Custom Effects Mode

Thanks to WLED, this reactor can be controlled via a mobile app or web browser, and it can be integrated into smart home systems for enhanced convenience and functionality.

Each phase is accompanied by sound simulations of the reactor (electricity, turbine, SciFi sounds) to enhance the immersive experience.
